The vehicle itself is a Rpi 4 powered car, with a two-joint pneumatic excavator-style arm and pneumatic bucket attached. 
It has a typical differential back 2-wheel drive, powered by a single Lego XL motor. The front steering is a servo-driven rack and pinion. There is also a servo-driven turntable for the upper body, arm, and electronics which will be lumped in with the drive controls.
