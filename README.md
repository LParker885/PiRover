# PiRover

Current code for the website is in the current website folder, the old website folder is from a similar project I did and is what I'm working from as a base template for now. The stuff in the current folder is the current robot-side python which will do the movin and shakin of the bot itself. 

The vehicle itself is a Rpi 4 powered car, with a two-joint pneumatic excavator-style arm and pneumatic bucket attached. 
It has a typical differential back 2-wheel drive, powered by a single Lego XL motor. The front steering is a servo-driven rack and pinion. There is also a servo-driven turntable for the upper body, arm, and electronics which will be lumped in with the drive controls.
