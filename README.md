# PiRover

Current code for the website is in the current website folder, the old website folder is from a similar project I did and is what I'm working from as a base template for now. The stuff in the current folder is the current robot-side python which will do the movin and shakin of the bot itself. 

The vehicle itself is a Rpi 4 powered car, with a two-joint pneumatic excavator-style arm and pneumatic bucket attached. 
It has a typical differential back 2-wheel drive, powered by a single Lego XL motor. The front steering is a servo-driven rack and pinion. There is also a servo-driven turntable for the upper body, arm, and electronics which will be lumped in with the drive controls. 

I should probably mention that the robot is built out of legos because they are easy to build really complicated stuff with in fairly short amounts of time, and with no 3d printing or nonsense like that.
