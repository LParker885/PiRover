# PiRover


The vehicle itself is a Rpi 4 powered car, with a two-joint pneumatic excavator-style arm and pneumatic bucket attached. 
It has a typical differential back 2-wheel drive, powered by a single Lego XL motor. The front steering is a servo-driven rack and pinion. There is also a servo-driven turntable which has the upper body, arm, and electronics mounted to it lumped in with the drive controls. 

I should probably mention that the robot is built out of legos because they are easy to build really complicated stuff with in fairly short amounts of time, and with no 3d printing or nonsense like that.
